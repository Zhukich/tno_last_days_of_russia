 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_ANDREEV_DESC:0 "Born 1905, Nikolai Trofimovich Andreev was called up from the reserves to fully rejoin the Red Army in 1935, initially a political commissar in Siberia. Hoping to fight on the frontline against the Germans, he was instead enrolled in officers' school. But as the war became more and more desperate, he continued taking more and more classes - not to become more skilled, but to hopefully delay being sent to fight for what he saw as a lost cause. As the Soviet Union collapsed, he and a clique of fellow officers' school graduates began to consolidate their power in the Krasnoyarsk region. Yet when the Central Siberian Republic was established, they were justifiably concerned about any pre-existing groups that would threaten the democratic institutions and so the government broke up the clique and assigned them to the far-reaching corners of the Republic. Andreev was placed under the command of Nikolay Krylov, secretly remaining in contact with his clique.\n\nAs the Republic began to lose its grip on power and crumble apart, the clique reunited in Krasnoyarsk and mutinied against General Krylov during his doomed campaign against the Siberian Black Army. Now in order to convince the people of the city that they were not just another flavor of junta, Andreev and his officers have promised new and sweeping reforms. Free trade! Private property! Foreign allies! Open elections! Liberty! Democracy!\n\nWith the collapse of the previous order, the clique is considering that the matter of the Siberian reunification rests in their hands. Following that it will be a mad dash to the sea, and with it foreign recognition, before consolidating and preparing a push to liberate all of Russia. But whether Andreev will actually be able to deliver on these promises is another matter entirely."
 
 MILITARY_NIKOLAI_ANDREEV_DESC:0 "§LBorn 1905 in Moscow, Nikolai Trofimovich Andreev worked as a messenger, blacksmith's apprentice and printer before finally joining the Red Army in 1935, becoming an infantry commander in the 93rd Rifle Division and then military commissar of the Taishet district in the Irkutsk region in 1938. Originally eager to go to the front when Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Andreev was instead sent east to take officer courses. Yet as the Soviet Union began to collapse under the German onslaught and the Politburo evacuated east, he instead made every effort to delay being sent to fight and with a clique of fellow officer school graduates solidified power in the city of Krasnoyarsk. Initially treated with suspicion by the Central Siberian Republic, Andreev's clique was broken apart and scattered across various assignments, with Andreev himself placed under the command of Nikolay Krylov. Capable however of seeing the writing on the wall during the Siberian War, Andreev reassembled his clique in their old base of power and mutinied against Krylov, putting an end to the Central Siberian Republic."
 MILITARY_ALEXEY_PESTEREV_DESC:0 "§LBorn 1910 in Buryatia, Alexey Ivanovich Pesterev worked as a collective farmer and builder, joining the Communist Party in 1939 before being drafted into the Red Army in 1941. Serving as a political commissar in the 209th Infantry Division, Pesterev rose rapidly to become Acting Commander of the 932th Infantry Regiment through both personal merit and the sheer rate of attrition suffered in the face of the German onslaught through the Soviet Union. Evacuating what little remained of his regiment across the Urals under heavy fire, Pesterev was placed under the command of Nikolai Andreev who, impressed by Pesterev's resolve, quickly inducted him into his own clique. Assigned a key role in the mutiny against Nikolay Krylov, Pesterev secured crossings across the Yenisei River, stranding several of Krylov's regiments on the west bank and ensuring their destruction at the hands of the Siberian Black Army.§!"
 MILITARY_NIKOLAI_LYASHCHENKO_DESC:0 "§LBorn in Irkutsk in 1910, Nikolai Grigoryevich Lyaschenko spent his early life in Kyrgyzstan becoming a groom and blacksmith before joining the local trade union committee and then volunteering for the Red Army in 1929. Serving in the Sino-Soviet conflict with distinction, he was sent to the Central Asian Military School and graduated in 1932, serving as an infantry commander in the 73rd Infantry Division. Awarded the Order of the Red Star for merit in 1936, Lyaschenko served in the Spanish Civil War as a military advisor and returned with the Order of the Red Banner, immediately being sent for further study upon his return. An early member of the graduate clique of Nikolai Andreev during the Soviet collapse, Lyaschenko was sent to Novosibirsk as part of the Central Siberian Republic's effort to break apart the clique, serving with characteristic valor in the Siberian War. It was to be short lived however, returning to Krasnoyarsk following Alexander Pokryshkin's betrayal of the Republic, only to end up betraying the Republic himself.§!"
 MILITARY_ALEKSANDRA_SAMUSENKO_DESC:0 "§LBorn in 1922 and rumored to have served in the Spanish Civil War in her teens, Aleksandra Grigoryevna Samusenko joined the Red Army in 1935. Originally serving in an infantry platoon, she served first in the Russo-Finnish 'Winter War' before graduating from the tank academy and joining the 1st Guards Tank Army as their only female tanker. Highly decorated for bravery and a recipient of the Order of the Red Star, Samusenko led the battered remnants of the 97th Tank Brigade of the Guard over the Urals following Operation Barbarossa and joined her Brigade to the Central Siberian Republic. Placed under the command of Nikolay Krylov, the destruction of the tank corps of the Grand Army of the Republic in the Siberian War pushed Samusenko into joining Nikolai Andreev in his mutiny against Krylov, the final nail in the Republic's coffin.§!"

 KRS_wild_promises_desc:0 "The people were, to say the least, skeptical about our government following the failures of both the Soviet Union and the subsequent Central Siberian Republic. To gain their support President Andreev has promised the world to them, offering all manner of social, political and economic reform in every bombastic speech. Yet whilst the Generalissimo may have them enthralled for now, soon the people will demand we deliver. With the true state of the nation far more precarious than we have led the people to believe, the path we walk is narrow and treacherous, but should we succeed we might just be able to give them the world."
 KRS_military_guided_democracy:0 "Military Guided Democracy"
 KRS_military_guided_democracy_desc:0 "Experiencing first hand the failures of a civilian led democracy to prevent the total social and military collapse of the Central Siberian Republic, our system of government was codified to ensure administration is shared between the people and the military. The Office of President is held by the Chief of the Army, appointed by the General Staff, whilst the Prime Minister and National Assembly are democratically elected by the people. However, the President, and thus the military, must consent to the formation of any new civilian government, and can dismiss both it and legislation at whim."

As our young Republic now takes its first steps, and the military's involvement in and influence over our politics becomes more common, many fear whether the sins of the past will become the sins of tomorrow.\n\n§RThe military may decide to act should they become dissatisfied with our government.§!"

 KRS.2.t:0 "The People's Apocalypse"
 KRS.2.d:0 "A nation of writers, poets and scholars, the universities of Tomsk produce more manuscripts and manifestoes than most people care to count. Yet one piece, published anonymously, has begun to spread controversy far and wide throughout Siberia. 'The People's Apocalypse' tells the story of a faceless scholar's journey throughout the fall of the Central Siberian Republic, progressively encountering those who the author identifies as the four horsemen of the apocalypse: Ivan Zavoloko, Genrikh Yagoda, Alexander Pokryshkin and Nikolai Andreev.\n\nAwaking in Oyrotia after falling ill, the scholar finds the people reduced to babbling madmen, clawing out their own eyes and pulling apart their scalps from a pestilence brought to the land from Zavoloko, poisoning his people with an elixir named faith and weakening the body of the Republic. Chased away by the blind and corrupted, the scholar soon finds himself witness to the lands being set ablaze and the free thinkers abducted and persecuted by Yagoda as blue faced demons wage war against the people. Fleeing the slaughter they come upon endless roads buried under living skeletons, famine consuming the land from Pokryshkin's terrible betrayal, before finally witnessing Andreev's betrayal at Krasnoyarsk, piercing the heart of a nameless soldier embodying the noble Republic.\n\nCondemning the four men as bringing about the end of the promised People's Realm, the story ends with the land destroyed and all four being consumed by madness under the weight of their own evil, turning to stone as hideous reminders of their deeds, though it is left unanswered whether anyone will survive this end of days to remember what has been lost."

 KRS.11.d:0 "When our young nation was first declared by President Andreev on the steps of the Krasnoyarsk city hall, the Generalissimo promised the people that they now lived in a land of laws, of fair trials, of justice. Both for our own people, and for our enemies. Whilst most will never know that it occurred, today we have made true on that promise. Captured during an attempt to commit suicide following the capture of Kemerovo, and having spend the past seven days under guard in a military hospital, this morning the court martial of Marshal Nikolai Krylov began before a tribunal of seven army officers.\n\nFormerly having styled himself as Rurik II, Krylov bore no crown or regal regalia, instead having been dressed in his old army uniform on the orders of the President. With the charges declared as misconduct, looting, desertion, resisting arrest, abuse of controlled substances and treason against the Republic, the old Marshal entered his plea of not guilty. Throughout the afternoon elements of the 62nd Army, Grand Army of the Republic, and Krylov's own officer corps from Kemerovo provided testimony against him, Krylov providing only disjointed murmurings in his defense. Sweating, with difficulty concentrating and mild tremors in his hands, Krylov's legal representative made a final attempt to have him declared innocent by means of mental degeneracy, yet it fell on deaf ears, the verdict rendered as guilty on all counts after several hours deliberation.\n\nEscorted in silence outside, the sentence was carried out immediately at the hands of the firing squad. Not a king's death, but a soldier's one. When asked if he had any final words to speak, he spoke none, merely stiffening his spine and lifting his chin an inch toward the sky."
